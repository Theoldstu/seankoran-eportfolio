<h3>Born in Marshfield, Wisconsin in February of 1994, and as a lover of all things abstract and left of field, Sean is a muscian, producer, and photographer.  Having been blessed enough for his endeavors to take him on multiple trips around the country, Sean is currently finishing up a full length album which will be the debut for his new project.  Cities Sean has called home are Eau Claire, WI - Portland, OR - Minneapolis, MN - New York, NY</h3>
